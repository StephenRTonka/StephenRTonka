Type of Testing

Functional Testing

Regression Testing

UI/Usability Testing

Performance Testing

Security Testing

Responsiveness Testing

Risks and Issues

Risk	Mitigation
Unstable payment gateway	Use sandbox/test accounts during QA
Lack of sufficient test data	Generate demo user accounts and mock products
Device/browser inconsistencies	Cross-browser/device testing early in cycle

3. Define Test Objectives
Objectives

Functionality: All key workflows (login, cart, checkout) should function as expected

GUI: Interface should be consistent, modern, and intuitive

Performance: Pages should load within 2 seconds; checkout within 3 seconds under average load

Security: Prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF); secure data transmission

Responsiveness: Website must render and function properly on all device types and screen sizes

Expected Outcomes

Functional: All core features work correctly and handle edge cases

GUI: Clean layout with responsive design

Performance: Meets or exceeds SLA targets

Security: Passes OWASP-based tests

Usability: Easy to use with minimal learning curve

4. Define Test Criteria
Suspension Criteria

Critical defects (e.g., cart not updating, payment failing) that block further testing

Testing environment is unavailable or payment sandbox is down

Exit Criteria

95% of test cases executed

At least 90% of executed test cases passed

No open severity 1 or 2 defects

All critical and high-priority bugs fixed and retested

Performance and security benchmarks met

UAT sign-off received from end users

5. Resource Planning
